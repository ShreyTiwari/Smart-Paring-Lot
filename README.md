# Smart-Paring-Lot
Repo to display the project where we learn to use the Arduino platform and its sensor environment for fast prototyping. 
<br /><br />

The project was a model of a parking with some smart features that would be very helpful in the practical world where there exist parking lots suffering from congestion problems. The project used sensors to detect vehicles and LEDs to indicate the free parking slots.<br /> 
In addition, there was a smart gate that would keep count of the number of vehicles entered and exited the parking lot. An LCD display would show the number of empty slots and the gate wouldn't open when the lot became full.
<br /><br />

The hardware parts used for this project were: <br />
- Arduino Board<br />
- LDR Sensors<br />
- LCD Display Module<br />
- LED's<br />
- Power Distribution Board<br />
- Servo Motors<br /><br />

The main aim of this project was to gain exposure to the fast prototyping techniques, so as to better convert your ideas into reality. Programmable boards introduce us to a different programming style and also requires us to write efficient source code due to the lack of compute power on board.
